# Contact form using React and Redux

## Getting started

Dependencies
- Node.js
- Webpack ( run `npm install -g webpack` after installing Node)

Steps to get the build running
1. Install the dependancies
1. run `npm install`
1. run `npm start`
1. Site should start up and be viewable at `http://localhost:8888`

To Build for production: `npm run build`

build will go into the `public` directory.

## Information

The build stack including Webpack config and NPM packages is my usual stack when creating React projects.
Due to this, it may have a few unnecessary packages or tasks.
  
The build was originally based on [https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel](https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel)
